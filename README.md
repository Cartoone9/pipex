# pipex

This is my Pipex project, where the goal was to build a C program that simulates shell piping ('|') and redirections ('<' with '>', and '<<' with '>>' as a bonus). It was a deep dive into UNIX system calls for process management, including fork, pipe, dup2, and execve, providing critical insights into how the shell executes commands. 

## Usage

To compile the program, navigate to the project root and run:
```Bash
make
```

or

```Bash
make bonus
```

## Note on Project State

All projects from my 42 cursus are preserved in their state immediately following their final evaluation. While they may contain mistakes or stylistic errors, I've chosen not to alter them. This approach provides a clear and authentic timeline of my progress and learning journey as a programmer.
